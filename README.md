### Hi! I'm Josh from Minnesota!

- I stuck a fork in a light socket 3 times as a kid
- In 2020, I wrote an [extremely fast Ruby framework](https://github.com/joshmn/jeanine) and named it after my mom. She was not by any means the most fleet afoot
- Currently obsessing over [frameworks that make developer's lives easier](https://github.com/joshmn/gearhead)
- I love to chat. Find me at anyemail@josh.mn or [@joshmn](https://twitter.com/joshmn)
